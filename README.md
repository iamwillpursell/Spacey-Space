# Spacey Space
This project was an exploration into using web requests in React. Each day Spacey Space is updated with a new spectacular photo, title, date, and description that is provided through the APOD api from NASA. This project also includes routing using the 'react-router-dom'. Space Space was made because of my deep interest in space and code.
